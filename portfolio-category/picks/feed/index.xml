				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patrol USA is a startup apparel company focused on making high-quality, American made, rugged, stylish clothing. Their line is mainly focused around pants, but has branched out into accessories.</p>
<p>I strategized with Patrol USA to create a series of videos that would serve as the driving force to re-up their line of pants. In preparing for the version 2.0 of their ‘Moab Pant,’ Patrol USA decided to use crowd funding to re-create the buzz of their first product drop. I created all the media surrounding their crowd funding campaign and product drop. It compromised of a flagship video, 6 social videos, and 40 images.</p>
<p>The project was successful with almost $35,000 of funding. This is $10,000 higher than their original goal.</p>
<p>The entire campaign was shot over the course of 3 days in Moab, Utah.</p>
<p>These 6 social videos were broken out of the flagship video. The goal was to tell the companies story over the course of 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Several ranching and farming communities living against the stunning landscape of the Rocky Mountain Front in Montana are faced with the decision of what is to become of this unprotected public land. As the community battles with the idea of proposing more wilderness areas, heritage and tradition are seemingly defended on both sides. When the people begin to raise their voices, they come to find that what is feared most is change.</p>
<p>A RED REEL film, Common Ground was made possible by The Conservation Alliance and three of it&#8217;s members; CLIF Bar, Osprey Packs, and Horny Toad Clothing.</p>
